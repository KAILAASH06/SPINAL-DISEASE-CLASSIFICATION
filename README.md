This project focuses on building a simple and effective machine learning model, primarily focused on Logistic Regression to classify orthopaedic conditions (Abnormal cases – Disc Herina, Spondylolisthesis versus Normal) using basic biomechanical measurements. It includes exploring the dataset through visual plots and statistical tests to understand how each feature behaves and how strongly they contribute to the condition. Since some features were highly correlated, VIF-based feature selection was used to pick the most meaningful parameters for both binary and multi-class classification.

Different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Bayesian approaches were trained and compared. SMOTE was applied to handle the class imbalance, which helped the model perform more fairly across all classes. Among all the models tested, Logistic Regression with the selected features gave the most balanced and reliable results.

The final model was saved and deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to enter biomechanical values and get predictions directly through a simple web interface. The overall workflow remained clean, without data leakage, and showed how proper feature selection and class balancing can improve performance even with a small medical dataset. This project shows a practical way to build an interpretable and lightweight ML tool for supporting orthopaedic assessments.
